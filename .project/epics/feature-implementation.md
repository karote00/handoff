# Feature Implementation EPIC: Building with Handoff

This EPIC provides a structured approach for implementing new features while maintaining consistency with existing architectural patterns and leveraging the knowledge preserved in your Handoff system.

## Goal

To implement new features that seamlessly integrate with existing codebase patterns, maintain architectural consistency, and build upon the accumulated knowledge in your Handoff documentation.

## 🔍 Implementation-Area Pattern Communication Protocol

### **When AI Encounters Pattern Conflicts in Implementation Area**

**Only flag inconsistencies in code directly related to current implementation:**

**Scope of Analysis:**
- ✅ Files you need to modify for this feature
- ✅ Functions you need to integrate with
- ✅ Modules you need to extend or call
- ✅ Similar functionality you need to match
- ❌ Unrelated parts of the codebase
- ❌ Files you won't touch
- ❌ Legacy code that doesn't affect current work

**Communication Process:**
1. **Stop and inform user** about conflicts in the implementation area
2. **Show specific examples** from files you'll be working with
3. **Offer clear options** for the current implementation
4. **Get user approval** before continuing
5. **Document the decision** in assumptions.md for future reference

### **Communication Template**
```
⚠️ PATTERN INCONSISTENCY IN IMPLEMENTATION AREA

I found conflicting [pattern type] in the code I need to work with:

**Files I need to modify/integrate with:**
- File A (I need to modify): [specific example of pattern 1]
- File B (I need to integrate with): [specific example of pattern 2]  
- File C (similar functionality): [specific example of pattern 3]

**For this new implementation, I can:**
A) Follow Pattern 1 approach (matches File A I'm modifying)
B) Follow Pattern 2 approach (matches File B I'm integrating with)
C) Follow Pattern 3 approach (matches similar functionality)
D) Create adapter to work with existing patterns

**Which approach would you prefer?**
```

### **Common Pattern Conflicts to Watch For**
- **Async patterns**: callbacks vs promises vs async/await
- **Error handling**: exceptions vs error objects vs result types
- **Component patterns**: class vs functional components
- **State management**: local state vs global state vs context
- **API patterns**: REST vs GraphQL vs RPC
- **Testing patterns**: unit vs integration test approaches
- **Import patterns**: ES6 vs CommonJS vs dynamic imports
