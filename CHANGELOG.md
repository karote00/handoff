## [0.1.8] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **ðŸš€ inject-docs Command**: Revolutionary bidirectional documentation flow
  - `handoff-ai inject-docs` - Injects Handoff documentation back into code as inline documentation
  - **Multi-language support**: JavaScript/TypeScript (JSDoc), Python (docstrings), Java (Javadoc), and more
  - **Smart detection**: Automatically detects functions, classes, and methods in source files
  - **Contextual documentation**: Uses Handoff knowledge to generate relevant inline docs
  - **Dry-run mode**: Preview changes before applying with `--dry-run` flag
  - **File filtering**: Target specific files with `--files` pattern option
  - **Language forcing**: Override detection with `--language` option

### Features
- **Bidirectional Documentation**: Complete the documentation cycle
  - Forward: Code â†’ Handoff docs (AI collaboration)
  - Reverse: Handoff docs â†’ Inline code documentation (inject-docs)
- **Language-Agnostic**: Works with JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust, PHP, Ruby, C/C++
- **Smart Integration**: Respects existing documentation, proper indentation, language-specific formats
- **Production Ready**: Handles real-world codebases with robust file detection and processing

### Technical Improvements
- Added `glob` dependency for advanced file pattern matching
- Enhanced CLI with comprehensive help and options
- Robust error handling and user feedback
- Efficient processing with dry-run capabilities

## [0.1.7] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **Pattern Inconsistency Communication Protocol**: Added to all EPIC workflows
  - AI now communicates pattern conflicts instead of silently choosing
  - Focuses on implementation-area-only conflicts (not entire codebase)
  - Provides clear options and examples for handling conflicts
  - Improves user understanding of codebase inconsistencies
- **Pattern Guidance in AI Quick Start**: Added pattern inconsistency guidance to ai-quick-start.md
  - Clear instructions for AI on how to handle conflicting patterns
  - Focus on implementation-relevant conflicts only
  - Always communicate with users before making pattern decisions

### Improved
- **Better Production Workflow Compatibility**: More transparent AI collaboration
- **Enhanced Knowledge Preservation**: Documentation sync ensures continuity
- **Reduced User Frustration**: Clear communication about pattern conflicts
- **More Practical for Real-World Development**: Works better with messy, inconsistent codebases

## [0.1.6] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **Quick Start Command**: Added `handoff-ai start` for new users
  - Guided setup experience with simple prompts
  - Friendly welcome message when running `handoff-ai` without commands
  - Provides clear next steps and example commands
  - Perfect for users who don't know CLI options

### Improved
- Enhanced user experience for first-time users
- Better onboarding flow with practical examples

## [0.1.5] - 2025-01-18

### Fixed
- Applied code formatting and autofix improvements
- Ensured consistent code style across all files

## [0.1.4] - 2025-01-18

### Fixed
- Fixed CLI version mismatch between package.json and bin/handoff.js
- Both now correctly report version 0.1.4

### Added
- Added comprehensive configuration documentation (docs/configuration.md)

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-18

### Added
- **Testing Command Guidelines**: Added comprehensive testing guidelines to `ai-quick-start.md` to prevent AI agents from using watch mode commands that hang processes
  - Guidance on using CI commands (`yarn test:ci`, `npm run test:run`) for documentation/analysis tasks
  - Warning against interactive commands (`yarn start`, `npm start`) that AI cannot control
  - Recommendations for automated testing tools (Playwright, Cypress) for browser testing
- **Documentation Sync Phase**: Added final documentation sync phase to all EPIC workflows
  - Ensures project documentation is updated before PR/merge
  - Preserves knowledge for future AI sessions and team members
  - Includes comprehensive documentation update checklist
  - Supports all engagement modes (High, Medium, Auto-Pilot)

### Changed
- Updated all EPIC files with new documentation sync phase:
  - `feature-implementation.md` - Phase 7: Documentation Sync & Handoff Preparation
  - `codebase-improvement.md` - Phase 6: Documentation Sync & Handoff Preparation  
  - `collaborative-documentation.md` - Phase 5: Documentation Sync & Handoff Preparation
  - `codebase-exploration.md` - Phase 7: Documentation Sync & Handoff Preparation

### Fixed
- Resolved issue where AI agents would hang on watch mode commands during documentation tasks
- Addressed knowledge loss when features are completed without updating project documentation

## [0.1.1] - Previous Release
