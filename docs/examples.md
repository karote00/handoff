# Integration Examples

This guide shows how to integrate Handoff AI with different development workflows, tools, and AI assistants.

## AI Assistant Integration

### Claude (Anthropic)

**Basic Integration:**
```
Hey Claude, I'm working on a React project. Please check my .project folder first, then help me implement user authentication using medium-engagement mode.
```

**Advanced Integration:**
```
Claude, please follow these steps:
1. Read .project/handoff-config.md to understand my preferences
2. Review .project/assumptions.md for previous decisions
3. Use the Feature Implementation EPIC from .project/epics/
4. Implement OAuth integration following our documented patterns
```

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

**Context Setup:**
```
I'm using Handoff AI for project knowledge management. Here's my configuration:

[Paste .project/handoff-config.md content]

Please help me refactor this component following our documented patterns and using auto-pilot mode.
```

**Workflow Integration:**
```
Please follow the Codebase Improvement EPIC to help me optimize this React app. Focus on performance and maintainability. Document all assumptions in the format specified in my .project folder.
```

### GitHub Copilot

**Enhanced Context:**
While Copilot doesn't read files directly, you can enhance its suggestions by:

1. **Open relevant docs:** Keep `.project/ai-quick-start.md` open in your editor
2. **Use comments:** Reference patterns from your documentation
3. **Consistent naming:** Follow conventions documented in your project

```javascript
// Following our authentication pattern from .project/assumptions.md
// Using JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration as documented
const authenticateUser = async (credentials) => {
    // Implementation follows our security guidelines
}
```

## Development Workflow Integration

### Git Hooks Integration

**Pre-commit Hook:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Update documentation before commit
if [ -f ".project/handoff-config.md" ]; then
    echo "Handoff AI: Checking documentation sync..."
    # Add your documentation update logic here
fi
```

**Post-merge Hook:**
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# .git/hooks/post-merge

# Notify about assumption updates
if git diff HEAD@{1} --name-only | grep -q ".project/assumptions.md"; then
    echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  AI assumptions updated - please review .project/assumptions.md"
fi
```

            **Workflow Guidance:**
            - `.project/epics/` - Development workflow patterns (if exists)
            
            ## Step 2: Analyze PR Changes
            Review the PR changes in the context of the project knowledge above.
            
            ## Step 3: Provide Context-Aware Feedback
            
            **Architecture Review:**
            - Does this change align with documented architectural decisions?
            - Are there any violations of documented constraints?
            
            **Pattern Compliance:**
            - Does the code follow established patterns from assumptions.md?
            - Is the implementation consistent with documented approaches?
            
            **Custom Criteria:**
            - Apply any specific rules from review-rules.md
            - Check against project-specific requirements
            
            **Documentation Impact:**
            - Does this change require updates to project documentation?
            - Should any new patterns be documented in assumptions.md?
            
            ## Step 4: Actionable Recommendations
            Provide specific, actionable feedback that references our documented decisions rather than generic best practices.
            
            Format your response with:
            - ‚úÖ What aligns well with our documented patterns
            - ‚ö†Ô∏è What needs attention based on our project rules
            - üìù What documentation updates might be needed
            - üöÄ Suggestions for improvement within our architectural constraints
```

### Claude + Handoff AI Best Practices

**1. Context Loading Pattern:**
```yaml
- name: Enhanced Context Loading
  run: |
    echo "üìö Claude Context Loading Instructions:"
    echo ""
    echo "Before reviewing code, please read our project context:"
    echo "1. .project/handoff-config.md (collaboration preferences)"
    echo "2. .project/assumptions.md (all project decisions)"
    echo "3. .project/review-rules.md (custom review criteria)"
    echo "4. .project/ai-quick-start.md (project overview)"
    echo ""
    echo "This context will help you provide project-specific feedback"
    echo "rather than generic code review comments."
```

**2. Incremental Context Updates:**
```yaml
- name: Context Change Detection
  run: |
    if git diff --name-only origin/main | grep -q ".project/"; then
      echo "üîÑ Project context has changed!"
      echo "Claude: Please pay special attention to updates in .project/ folder"
      echo "These changes may affect how you should review this PR."
    fi
```

**3. Multi-Stage Review:**
```yaml
- name: Multi-Stage Claude Review
  run: |
    echo "üéØ Multi-Stage Review Process:"
    echo ""
    echo "Stage 1 - Context Loading:"
    echo "Read .project/ folder for complete project understanding"
    echo ""
    echo "Stage 2 - Change Analysis:"
    echo "Analyze PR changes against loaded context"
    echo ""
    echo "Stage 3 - Pattern Validation:"
    echo "Check compliance with documented patterns and rules"
    echo ""
    echo "Stage 4 - Feedback Generation:"
    echo "Provide context-aware, actionable recommendations"
```

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Multi-Repository Projects

**Shared Configuration:**
```bash
# In each repository
ln -s ../shared-handoff/.project .project

# Or use git submodules
git submodule add https://github.com/yourorg/shared-handoff.git .project
```

**Cross-Repository Context:**
```markdown
# In .project/ai-quick-start.md
## Related Repositories
- **API:** ../api-service (authentication patterns)
- **Frontend:** ../web-app (component patterns)
- **Shared:** ../shared-lib (utility patterns)

When working across repositories, reference patterns from related projects.
```

### Microservices Architecture

**Service-Specific Configuration:**
```markdown
# .project/handoff-config.md for each service
## Service Context
- **Domain:** User Management
- **Dependencies:** Auth Service, Notification Service
- **Patterns:** Event-driven, CQRS
- **Shared Standards:** ../shared-standards/.project/
```

### Legacy Code Integration

**Gradual Adoption Strategy:**
```markdown
# Phase 1: Documentation
- Initialize Handoff AI in legacy project
- Use Codebase Exploration EPIC to understand existing patterns
- Document current architecture and decisions

# Phase 2: New Development
- Use Feature Implementation EPIC for new features
- Follow documented patterns for consistency
- Gradually improve documentation coverage

# Phase 3: Refactoring
- Use Codebase Improvement EPIC for systematic refactoring
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Update documentation as patterns evolve
```

## Troubleshooting Integration Issues

### Common Problems

**AI Not Using Project Context:**
```
‚ùå Problem: AI ignores .project folder
‚úÖ Solution: Explicitly reference files in your requests
Example: "Please read .project/ai-quick-start.md first, then help me..."
```

**Inconsistent AI Behavior:**
```
‚ùå Problem: Different AI responses across team members
‚úÖ Solution: Standardize requests using EPICs and document successful patterns
```

**Documentation Drift:**
```
‚ùå Problem: Inline docs become outdated
‚úÖ Solution: Regular `handoff-ai inject-docs` runs and CI checks
```

### Best Practices for Integration

1. **Start Small:** Begin with one EPIC and expand gradually
2. **Document Success:** Record what works for your team
3. **Iterate Regularly:** Update patterns based on experience
4. **Share Knowledge:** Make successful integrations available to the team
5. **Automate Where Possible:** Use CI/CD to maintain consistency
