## üé™ Collaboration Modes Explained

### **collaborate** (Rich Interaction)
- AI asks clarifying questions before proceeding
- Validates assumptions with human input
- Documents all decisions and reasoning
- **Best for**: Complex projects, critical decisions, learning scenarios

### **automatic** (Minimal Interaction)
- AI makes decisions independently
- Documents what it did and why
- Only asks for help when truly stuck
- **Best for**: Simple tasks, greenfield projects, routine work

### **guided** (Structured Decision-Making)
- AI presents options with pros/cons
- Human chooses, AI executes
- Educational explanations provided
- **Best for**: Learning, team environments, knowledge transfer

### **review-only** (Batch Feedback)
- AI completes entire tasks independently
- Presents final result for approval/rejection
- Most efficient for experienced developers
- **Best for**: Routine tasks, time pressure, high AI trust scenarios

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

### **CLI Architecture**
- **7 Modular Commands**: Each in separate file for maintainability
- **Clean Main CLI**: Reduced from 350+ lines to 60 lines
- **Easy Extension**: Adding new commands is now simple and clean
- **Better Testing**: Each command can be tested independently

### **Project Structure**
```
