# Handoff AI v0.1.7 Release Notes

## 🎯 New Features

### Testing Guidelines
- Added testing command guidelines to prevent watch mode hangs during documentation tasks

### Documentation Sync
- Added documentation sync phase to all EPICs
- Ensures project documentation stays current with code changes
- Maintains persistent knowledge across feature development

### Pattern Inconsistency Communication
- AI now communicates pattern conflicts instead of silently choosing
- Focuses on implementation-area-only conflicts (not entire codebase)
- Provides clear options and examples for handling conflicts
- Improves user understanding of codebase inconsistencies

## 🚀 Improvements
- Better production workflow compatibility
- More transparent AI collaboration
- Enhanced knowledge preservation
